=========================

Class Labs and Assignments

Computer Systems â€“ Covers how programs are represented and executed by modern computers, including 
low-level machine representations of programs and data, an understanding of how computer components 
influence performance and memory hierarchy

Gained Experience With: Bit-level representations of C data types, x86 assembly language, GDB debugging, 
                        stack discipline and the dangers of writing code that is vulnerable to buffer 
                        overflow attacks, cache memories, low-level program optimization, shell programs 
                        and application level concurrency.
